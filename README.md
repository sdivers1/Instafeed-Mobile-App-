# Instafeed-Mobile-App-

##What is this project about?
The name of this project is Instafeed and it is a mobile application created in Java and uses a SQLite database to store information. This mobile application uses location-based services to make an informed decision of which fast food chain around you is serving the best food and has an excellent customer service.
This project represents my understanding of Java, Android Studio, and SQLite while demonstrating my creativity with the UX/UI design. 

##How to run this project?
